## How to use

You can access Paintr on a Discord server: **SOON AVAILABLE**.
Once you are on the server, use the command `/paint` followed by a description of the image you would like to generate. The AI will then create an image based on your prompt.
You can also upscale an existing image with the `/upscale` command. (for big images, use `/light-upscale`).
